#Survey-Analysis

This project's main motive is to analyse the surveys conducted by 
StackOverFlow on its users(Developers) in 2019 and 2020.

The survey's can be downloaded from their site easily. 

Analysis involves basic Exploratory Data Analysis. 

The main objective was to find out the difference in different 
languages used per user based on the type of developer we have.

Diversity of the programmers is observed and the variation trends
for various features based on the survey results of 2019 and 2020.

No models are created. This project is stricly exploratory.
